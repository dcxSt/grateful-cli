# Grateful

Grateful is a command line interface (CLI) that enables you to boost your happyness by prompting you to write three things that you are grateful for every day. 

### Quick start

Install with this command *(macOS?, windows?, linux? does it work cross platform?)*

`command to install`

Enter 

`grateful`

into your terminal and it will prompt you to enter three things you're grateful for. 

```
What are you grateful for today? (3) > beans
What are you grateful for today? (2) > carrots
What are you grateful for today? (1) > potatoes
```

The **only** other commands are `grateful history` and `grateful last`. These commands display all of your entries and your last entry respectively.
